## Undergraduate Research

A. Arm Motion Measurement for Eccentric Driver Simulation
May 2021 - present
Astrophysics: Analyzing the spiral arm motion pattern activated by companions with eccentric orbits.
_Technical highlight_: Developing a package to fit spiral arm motion conveniently.[Github]

B. Spiral Arm Pattern Motion in the SAO 206462 Protoplanetary Disk ([ApJL])
Aug. 2020 â€“ Jan. 2021
Astrophysics: Analyzing the spiral arm motion of SAO 206462 system.
_Technical highlight_: Ruled out the gravitational instability mechanism for SAO 206462 system with only data of one year separation. 
_Scientific highlight_: Discovered the first system whose two spiral arms are driven by two planets respectively.
